**Repository Description:**

ðŸš€ **Frontend Masters DSA Course**

In this repository, you'll find my own implementations for the [Algorithms and Data Structures Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms) by Frontend Masters. The Frame of the Project is developed by ThePrimeagen.
Algorithm and Datastructure implementations can be found in kata-machine/src/{day}.

ðŸš€ **Developed and Implemented Independently!**

During this course, I didn't just acquire theoretical knowledge; I also gained practical experience by developing and documenting all the algorithms and data structures myself in this repository. It was a challenging but extremely rewarding experience. :muscle:

**What You Can Find Here:**

- **Algorithms:** From sorting algorithms to search algorithmsâ€”everything has been implemented by me.
- **Data Structures:** You'll find self-developed data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, and more.
- **Examples and Exercises:** For a deeper understanding and practical application of what I've learned.
